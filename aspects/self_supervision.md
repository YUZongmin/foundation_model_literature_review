# Self-Supervision Paradigms Across Domains

## Overview
This document analyzes how different foundation model domains implement self-supervision and how these approaches influence model learning and performance.

## Domain-Specific Paradigms

### Language Models
- [ ] Next token prediction
- [ ] Masked language modeling
- [ ] Contrastive learning

### Vision Models
- [ ] Masked image modeling
- [ ] Contrastive learning
- [ ] Image reconstruction

### PDEs (Low-Dim)
- [ ] Physics-informed losses
- [ ] Solution reconstruction
- [ ] Operator learning

### PDEs (High-Dim)
- [ ] Individual point fitting
- [ ] Local physics constraints
- [ ] Limited self-supervision
