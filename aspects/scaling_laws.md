# Scaling Laws Across Domains

## Overview
This document analyzes how different foundation model domains scale with respect to model size, data size, and computational resources.

## Domain-Specific Scaling

### Language Models
- [ ] Performance scales with model & data size
- [ ] Clear emergent capabilities
- [ ] Smooth learning curves
- [ ] Predictable performance improvements

### Vision Models
- [ ] Benefits from scale but less smoothly than language
- [ ] Architecture dependent scaling
- [ ] Non-linear scaling with resolution

### PDEs (Low-Dim)
- [ ] Limited by physical dimensionality
- [ ] Data collection scales poorly
- [ ] O(N^d) computational complexity for d dimensions
- [ ] Memory requirements grow exponentially with resolution

### PDEs (High-Dim)
- [ ] Curse of dimensionality in computation
- [ ] Exponential complexity with dimensions
- [ ] Data requirements grow exponentially
- [ ] Poor sample efficiency
