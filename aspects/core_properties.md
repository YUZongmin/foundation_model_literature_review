# Core Representation Properties Across Domains

## Overview
This document provides a cross-domain analysis of core representation properties in foundation models, examining how different domains encode and represent information.

## Domain-Specific Properties

### Language Models
- [ ] Contextual embeddings
- [ ] Token relationships
- [ ] Hierarchical structure
- [ ] Attention patterns

### Vision Models
- [ ] Visual features hierarchies
- [ ] Spatial relationships
- [ ] Multi-scale representations
- [ ] Local-to-global feature extraction

### PDEs (Low-Dim)
- [ ] Function space mappings
- [ ] Physical constraints
- [ ] Spatial/temporal correlations
- [ ] Conservation laws

### PDEs (High-Dim)
- [ ] Point-wise approximations
- [ ] High-dim function spaces
- [ ] Complex physical relationships
- [ ] Multi-scale physical interactions
