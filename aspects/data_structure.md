# Data Structure Across Domains

## Overview
This document analyzes how different foundation model domains structure their input data and how these structures influence model design and performance.

## Domain-Specific Structures

### Language Models
- [ ] Sequential
- [ ] Discrete tokens
- [ ] Clear hierarchical structure

### Vision Models
- [ ] Grid-based
- [ ] Continuous values
- [ ] Spatial hierarchies

### PDEs (Low-Dim)
- [ ] Continuous fields
- [ ] Physics-based structure
- [ ] Clear symmetries

### PDEs (High-Dim)
- [ ] Complex coupling
- [ ] Less clear structure
- [ ] High-dimensional manifolds
