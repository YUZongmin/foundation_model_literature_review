# Transfer Capabilities Across Domains

## Overview
This document analyzes how different foundation model domains handle transfer learning, including zero-shot, few-shot, and domain adaptation capabilities.

## Domain-Specific Transfer

### Language Models
- [ ] Strong zero-shot abilities
- [ ] Good few-shot learning
- [ ] Domain adaptation

### Vision Models
- [ ] Good transfer of low-level features
- [ ] Domain adaptation requires fine-tuning
- [ ] Compositional transfer

### PDEs (Low-Dim)
- [ ] Good within similar physics
- [ ] Limited across physics types
- [ ] Domain-specific adaptation

### PDEs (High-Dim)
- [ ] Very limited transfer
- [ ] Problem-specific solutions
- [ ] High adaptation cost
