# Vision Models in Foundation Model Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the characteristics and behaviors of vision models as foundation models, comparing their properties with other domains in our analysis matrix.

## Matrix Claims

### Core Representation Properties
- [ ] Visual features hierarchies
- [ ] Spatial relationships
- [ ] Multi-scale representations
- [ ] Local-to-global feature extraction

*Literature needed to support these claims*

### Scaling Laws
- [ ] Benefits from scale but less smoothly than language
- [ ] Architecture dependent scaling
- [ ] Non-linear scaling with resolution

*Literature needed to support these claims*

### Transfer Capabilities
- [ ] Good transfer of low-level features
- [ ] Domain adaptation requires fine-tuning
- [ ] Compositional transfer

*Literature needed to support these claims*

### Data Structure
- [ ] Grid-based
- [ ] Continuous values
- [ ] Spatial hierarchies

*Literature needed to support these claims*

### Self-Supervision Paradigms
- [ ] Masked image modeling
- [ ] Contrastive learning
- [ ] Image reconstruction

*Literature needed to support these claims*

## Current Findings
*To be filled as we validate claims*

## Open Questions
1. How do vision transformers compare to CNNs in terms of scaling?
2. What are the fundamental differences in self-supervision between vision and language?
3. How do architectural choices affect transfer learning capabilities?

## Key Papers to Review
*To be filled with paper summaries*
