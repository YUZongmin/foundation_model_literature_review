# Language Models in Foundation Model Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the characteristics and behaviors of language models as foundation models, focusing on how they compare to other domains in our analysis matrix.

## Matrix Claims

- [ ] Good few-shot learning
- [ ] Domain adaptation

*Literature needed to support these claims*

### Data Structure
- [ ] Sequential
- [ ] Discrete tokens
