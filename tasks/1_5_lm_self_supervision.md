## Research Workflow Notes

For each claim, follow standard validation process:
1. Strategic literature search (relevance & bulk)
2. Systematic analysis of evidence
3. Clear documentation of findings
4. Quality assessment and limitations
5. Integration with existing knowledge

See `/references/README.md` for detailed workflow and templates.
