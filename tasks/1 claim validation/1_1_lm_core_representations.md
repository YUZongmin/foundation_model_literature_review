2. [ ] Validate: Manifold structure of learned representations
3. [ ] Validate: Dimensionality characteristics across layers
4. [ ] Validate: Representation stability under input perturbations
5. [ ] Validate: Structure preservation across model scales

## C. Feature Organization

1. [ ] Validate: Feature disentanglement patterns
2. [ ] Validate: Emergence of specialized feature detectors
3. [ ] Validate: Hierarchical information organization
4. [ ] Validate: Cross-feature interaction patterns
5. [ ] Validate: Feature reuse across different tasks

## D. Dynamics & Training

1. [ ] Validate: Representation evolution during training

3. [ ] Validate: Optimization landscape structure
4. [ ] Validate: Role of initialization on final structure
5. [ ] Validate: Batch size impact on representation quality

## Research Workflow Notes

For each claim, follow standard validation process:

1. Strategic literature search (relevance & bulk)
2. Systematic analysis of evidence
3. Clear documentation of findings
4. Quality assessment and limitations
5. Integration with existing knowledge

See `/references/README.md` for detailed workflow and templates.
