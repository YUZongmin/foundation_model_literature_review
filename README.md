# Foundation Model Analysis Across Domains

This document provides a systematic analysis of foundation models across different domains, with a particular focus on comparing traditional domains (language, vision) with PDE-based domains. The analysis is structured to highlight key differences and similarities in various aspects of model development and behavior.

## Research Workflow

### 1. Claim Validation Process

For each claim in our matrix, follow these steps:

1. **Strategic Search**

   - **Targeted Search**
     - Use paper_relevance_search for direct claim validation
     - Target keywords from claim + related theoretical terms
     - Look for both supporting and challenging evidence
   - **Historical Context**
     - Use paper_bulk_search with filters:
       - Sort by citation count (highest first)
       - Filter by top venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc.)
       - Year ranges: both foundational (pre-2020) and recent (2020+)
   - **Quality Filters**
     - Citation threshold: 50+ for pre-2020, 20+ for recent papers
     - Venue quality check
     - Author track record in domain

2. **Systematic Paper Analysis**

   - **Initial Download**
     - Use arXiv tools for full text access
     - Prioritize papers by relevance and citation impact
   - **Structured Review**
     - Follow template from `/references/README.md`:
       - Key findings and methodology
       - Assumptions and limitations
       - Direct quotes supporting/challenging claim
       - Authors' confidence level
   - **Evidence Quality Check**
     - Empirical results: dataset size, methodology rigor
     - Theoretical results: proof technique, assumptions
     - Reproduction attempts and confirmations

3. **Structured Documentation**
   - **Evidence Organization**
     - Create domain-specific summaries in `/references/[domain]/`
     - Use standardized format for easy cross-reference
   - **Claim Status Updates**
     - [ ] Unchecked: No systematic review done
     - [?] Partially supported: Some evidence, needs more validation
     - [x] Well supported: Strong evidence from multiple sources
     - [-] Challenged: Significant contradicting evidence exists
   - **Citation Management**
     - Link evidence to specific claim components
     - Include brief context with each citation
     - Note evidence strength and limitations

### 2. Cross-Domain Analysis

After validating domain-specific claims:

1. Update cross-domain patterns in aspect files
2. Identify common principles
3. Document key differences
4. Note unique challenges

### 3. Gap Analysis

For each section:

1. List claims lacking strong evidence
2. Identify potential research directions
3. Note conflicting evidence
4. Highlight open questions

### 4. Synthesis

Regular synthesis of findings:

1. Update matrix with refined claims
2. Document emerging patterns
3. Revise research directions
4. Identify promising areas for deeper investigation

### 5. Research Management

- Track progress using checkboxes in markdown files
- Regular commits with meaningful messages
- Update main README.md with progress summaries
- Maintain paper reference quality using template
