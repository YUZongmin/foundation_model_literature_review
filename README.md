# Foundation Model Analysis Across Domains

This document analyzes the applicability and limitations of foundation models across different domains, focusing on key questions about their effectiveness, limitations, and supporting evidence.

## Domain Analysis Matrix

| Domain              | What makes foundation models work/not work? | What are the fundamental limitations? | What evidence supports these conclusions? |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Language Models** |                                             |                                       |                                           |
| **Vision Models**   |                                             |                                       |                                           |
| **PDEs**            |                                             |                                       |                                           |

## Guideline

For each domain, focus on one key question:

What makes foundation models work/not work in this domain?
What are the fundamental limitations?
What evidence supports these conclusions?
