# Foundation Model Analysis Across Domains

This document provides a systematic analysis of foundation models across different domains, with a particular focus on comparing traditional domains (language, vision) with PDE-based domains. The analysis is structured to highlight key differences and similarities in various aspects of model development and behavior.
